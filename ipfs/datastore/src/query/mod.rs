/// Query represents storage for any key-value pair.
///
/// tl;dr:
///
/// queries are supported across datastores.
/// Cheap on top of relational dbs, and expensive otherwise.
/// Pick the right tool for the job!
///
/// In addition to the key-value store get and set semantics, datastore
/// provides an interface to retrieve multiple records at a time through
/// the use of queries. The datastore Query model gleans a common set of
/// operations performed when querying. To avoid pasting here years of
/// database research, letâ€™s summarize the operations datastore supports.
///
/// Query Operations, applied in-order:
///
/// * prefix - scope the query to a given path prefix
/// * filters - select a subset of values by applying constraints
/// * orders - sort the results by applying sort conditions, hierarchically.
/// * offset - skip a number of results (for efficient pagination)
/// * limit - impose a numeric limit on the number of results
///
/// DataStore combines these operations into a simple Query class that allows
/// applications to define their constraints in a simple, generic, way without
/// introducing datastore specific calls, languages, etc.
///
/// However, take heed: not all datastores support efficiently performing these
/// operations. Pick a datastore based on your needs. If you need efficient look-ups,
/// go for a simple key/value store. If you need efficient queries, consider an SQL
/// backed datastore.
///
/// Notes:
///
/// * Prefix: When a query filters by prefix, it selects keys that are strict
///   children of the prefix. For example, a prefix "/foo" would select "/foo/bar"
///   but not "/foobar" or "/foo",
/// * Orders: Orders are applied hierarchically. Results are sorted by the first
///   ordering, then entries equal under the first ordering are sorted with the
///   second ordering, etc.
/// * Limits & Offset: Limits and offsets are applied after everything else.
